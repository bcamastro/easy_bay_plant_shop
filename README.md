This was a really fun enjoyable front end project using html, css, and javascript. I plan to add more to it in the near future for more practice.
I am also considering re-creating this in a future in other repositories using front end frameworks to familiarize myself
with different front end frame works.

My other consideration is creating a backend to this to complete a full stack. adding in a customer account area where they can see their order history, view their cart, and checkout.

**This is obviously a fake site, this is purely for fun and practice feel free to copy this code for your own practice aswell**
